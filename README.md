# Advanced-Data-Structure

This Python program, 'script.py', introduces an advanced data structure by implementing a dictionary named 'customer_info'. The dictionary contains keys such as 'name', 'age', and 'purchase_history', with corresponding values providing relevant information about the customer. The program uses the concept of lists within dictionary.

The program prints specific information from the 'customer_info' dictionary:
- The customer's name.
- The customer's second purchase from the purchase history.
